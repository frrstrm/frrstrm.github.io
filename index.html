                <p class="bio-text">
                    Greetings and welcome! I'm Dakota (or Kota; whichever rolls off the tongue a bit easier).  My journey has woven through the intricate, yet varied, realms of craftsmanship, technology, and music. Allow me to offer you a bit more of detailed glimpse into my narrative:
                    
                    Over the past 12 years, my love for lutherie has been a guiding force. As an independent craftsman, I dedicated myself to the meticulous creation of harmonious instruments, pouring my soul into each piece. This passion led me to a pivotal chapter at Two Old Hippies, where, as a Production Lead and Quality Manager, I played a key role in maintaining the exceptional standards of brands such as Breedlove and Bedell. This experience deepened my understanding of craftsmanship and the nuanced artistry of creating luxurious guitars.
                    
                    In 2020, recognizing the evolving landscape, I decided to pivot towards technology. I pursued a Bachelor's in Computer Science, successfully graduating in August 2023. This educational journey has allowed me to merge my profound appreciation for innovation with the artistic sensibilities cultivated in the world of lutherie.
                    
                    Beyond the professional realm, I find solace and inspiration in exploring the natural world alongside my wonderful wife and two cherished companions. Whether capturing the serenity of untouched landscapes or immersing myself in the dynamic energy of vibrant cities, my camera becomes an extension of my storytelling.
                    
                    Whether your interest lies in music, technology, or the broader spectrum of my experiences, I genuinely appreciate your presence on this journey. Together, let's craft something beautiful—be it through lines of code, the meticulous creation of finely tuned instruments, or the expressive freedom found in trading bars of jazz.
                    
                    Thank you for taking a moment in my little corner of the web. Feel free to connect, ask questions, or share your own story—I'm eager to continue this adventure with you.

            <h2>The Pathway to Now</h2>
            <p>
                <b>1999</b>: My musical journey kicked off when I received my first instrument on my 4th Christmas; a gift that would become a companion through the years and a spark for a deep-seated love affair a kid never could've imagined.  A candy red Squier Mini Strat accompanied by a trusty Fender Frontman 15W.  The ingredients of an unrelenting obsession with the guitar.

                <b>1999-2007</b>: With an insatiable curiosity and intrinsic love for music, I ventured into self-taught guitar playing. Those early years were filled with countless hours of practice, exploration, callous-growth, and the beginnings of an eitquette of how to properly own and care for the world's best instrument.
                
                <b>2007-2013</b>: As skills and psyche matured, so did my appreciation for the craftsmanship behind musical instruments. During this period, I found myself fully immersed in the world of repairing and modifying guitars through my youth and high school years. Intensively studying the works of the traditional greats like Fender, Gibson, Martin and the like, later diving deeper into the more experimental and artsy works of Strandberg, Kuun, Rick Toone, and the likes.  Without a doubt, I was hooked.  Every second of it was a humbling and motivating experience, navigating the delicate balance between preserving the instrument's character and enhancing its playability.
                
                <b>2014-2020</b>: The next chapter unfolded at Two Old Hippies, where I had the utmost privilege of contributing to the legacy of Breedlove Guitars, Bedell Guitars, and Weber Mandolins. From the ground up, I worked my way through each production department. Following years of blood, sweat, tears, and endless love, I found myself entrusted with the roles of serving as the company's USA/Custom Shop Quality Assurance Manager, Sound Optimization Manager, and Lead Luthier for our Bend, OR based production. It was an incredible journey, marked by collaboration, challenges, and a constant pursuit of excellence.  An experience I'll never forget.
                
                <b>2020-2023</b>: Between 2020 and 2023, my journey unfolded as I ventured into diverse realms, shaping my professional and personal growth. During this period, I navigated a transition from the lively production floor to the personalized world of private lutherie under the banner of Farrstrom Soundworks.  Simultaneously acknowledging the dynamic landscape of technology, I returned to university for a Bachelor's in Computer Science. This era marked the critical intersection of my experiences in craftsmanship and my future in computer science.  A never-ending challenge that continually reminds me of the boundless knowledge yet to be explored along my journey.
                
                In tandem with these transitions, my professional path took another significant turn. From 2021 to 2022, I served as a Services Software Developer and Quality Assurance Engineer at BIOVIA. Here, I contributed to developing cutting-edge laboratory solutions for leading Fortune 500 Biotech companies, including Altria, Juul, and Bristol Meyers Squibb. This experience not only deepened my understanding of software development but also provided valuable insights into the critical role technology plays in advancing biotech innovations.  In addition, this era refined my understanding of who I was, am, and expect to become in this experience of life: A guitar obsessed music professional.
                
                <b>Now</b>: As I navigate these diverse paths, whether crafting harmonious instruments or ensuring the precision of technology solutions, each experience adds deeper layers to my narrative. The richness of this journey lies in the unexpected intersections of passion and profession. The adventure continues, and I'm grateful to share it with you.
